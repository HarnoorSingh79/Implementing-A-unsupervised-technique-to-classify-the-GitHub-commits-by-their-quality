# Implementing-A-unsupervised-technique-to-classify-the-GitHub-commits-by-their-quality

### Project Inspiration 
We all have seen projects where we try to classify the quality of projects based on some stats to achieve some objective. This is a similar project but with the intent to build a system that can potentially help the developer to efficiently manage his project by giving high priority to certain commits. 

### Objective 
Build a system that can classify the GitHub commits on basis of their quality using an unsupervised method (K-medoids). we will also use random forest algorithm to check if unsurpised methoad hav achived its objective or not.
